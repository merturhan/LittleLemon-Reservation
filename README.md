# LittleLemon-Reservation
 LittleLemon-Reservation App - SwiftUI
 
It's a basic restaurant reservation app. It shows a list of restaurant locations. Each of these restaurant locations is tappable. After tapping a location, reservation screen appears. It asks the number of party member, Date and Time, some personal informations and note to forward.
I used NavigationView, TabView, DatePicker.
